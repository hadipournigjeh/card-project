            <h1>Nissan 370Z</h1>
            <p>The Nissan 370z is one of the best Japanese sports cars ever made. The street version is an ordinary car by all possible standards, and nothing stands out about it. It features a standard V6 engine that outputs 328 horsepower. Yet this car has managed to win various formula drift championships under different sets of drivers, so what's the secret?</p>

            <h1>BMW M3 (E36)</h1>
            <p>Very few people can fault German engineering when it comes to auto-manufacturing, and this compact drift-ready model proves just that. The car defies time; it was introduced in the 1990s but is still relevant today due to its fantastic drift DNA.</p>

            <h1>Nissan 240SX S14</h1>
            <p>The compact Japanese models are manufactured with very efficient weight distribution, and they are also highly customizable, making them great cars for drifting. The 240 SX, however, has a lot more to offer with its spacious front hood, which allows for numerous upgrades.</p>

            <h1>Mazda MX-5 Miata</h1>
            <p>Another Japanese car on this list underlines Japan's knack for producing drift masters, both drivers, and machines. The Miata is another time-defying vehicle that is still very valuable in the drift circles.

            <h1>Toyota Supra</h1>
            <p>Just like numerous other cars on this list, the Toyota Supra seems to make time stand still. The vehicle transcends through time like a real pro. The most sought-after drift version, the A80, was unveiled in the 1990s, but it still fetches a fortune on the current market.</p>
